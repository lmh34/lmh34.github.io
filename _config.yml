  As a data scientist, I combine a robust technical and quantitative skill base with the communication and research skills of my education and psychology background to execute innovative analytical solutions and translate them to application. I am actively seeking a new role in an innovative, growing, data-mature company where I can join a strong team, solve challenging problems, and communicate insights across audiences.
