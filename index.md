[Machine Learning at Scale: Flight Delay Prediction](/flight_delay_prediction)
<br>Can flight delays be predicted two hours before their scheduled departure times? This Machine Learning at Scale project used Spark, Databricks, and 5 years of U.S. flight and weather data to predict flight delays of at least 15 minutes at 2 hours in advance of scheduled departure. These predictive insights can empower proactive, data-driven strategies to minimize disruptions caused by delays, yielding improved customer satisfaction and reduced operational costs.

<br>
Does a paid Google SEO ad campaign with wellness and lifestyle-oriented messaging generate more
site traffic than one with productivity-oriented messaging? This causal inference project partnered
with Vyu for the launch of the Tune In supplement drink line and used Google Analytics to A/B test
distinct product campaigns.
