## Flight Delay Prediction at Scale 
<br>
**Project description:** Can we predict whether flights will be delayed two hours before their scheduled departure times? 
<br>
<br>

### 1. Introduction/Problem Context
<br>
Timely flight performance is a crucial competitive factor in the airline industry: high volumes of delayed flights can increase operational costs and reduce customer satisfaction. This machine learning at scale project used Spark, Databricks, and 5 years of U.S. domestic flight and weather data, Spark, and Databricks to predict flight delays of 15 minutes or more 2 hours in advance of scheduled departure times. These predictive insights can empower proactive, data-driven strategies to minimize disruptions caused by delays, yielding improved customer satisfaction and reduced operational costs.
